# SQLServer2CSpro
Convert SQL server database to CSPro data file

Takes census/survey data stored in tables in SQL Server and converts to CSPro format for further processing.

Consists of two programs:

1. SQLServer2Dictionary: generates a CSPro data dictionary from selected tables in SQL Server database

2. SQLServer2CSPro: given a CSPro data dictionary generated by SQLServer2Dictionary, converts data from the SQL Server database to a CSPro data file in text format.

Tables in the SQL Server database are mapped to records in the CSPro data dictionary.

The systems makes a few assumptions:

* Table names in the SQL server database will match record names in the CSPro dictionary
* Column names in the SQL server database will match item names in the CSPro dictionary
* The items used as id-items in CSPro will correspond to columns appearing in each table in SQL server, with the same name, in order to link together rows in the same case.

SQLServer2Dictionary is a WPF program allowing the user to select tables and id-items from SQL server. It is meant to be run rarely; only when the database schema changes.

SQLServer2CSPro is a console application that is meant to be run regularly (e.g. on a scheduled task) whenever the data in the database are modified.
